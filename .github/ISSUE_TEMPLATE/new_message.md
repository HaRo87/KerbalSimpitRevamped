## Is it a message from Arduino to KSP, from KSP to Arduino or both ?

## What do you want to transmit ? Is there already a message that contains part of what you want ?

## Would it be more suited to be a new message or to be added to an existing message ? Is so, which message ?

## Do you know if the KSP API allow us to get/set this from the mod ? Do you know any other mod that show/set this so that we can look up how to get/set this data ?
